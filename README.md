# TripBuddy
Trip Buddy is a virtual travel assistant that can suggest travel destination city.
It also suggests interesting places and activities at the destination. It also provides information about hotels within your budget near the places/events of interest. The destination listings are based on the userâ€™s interests. This system is just a prototype that takes in the following assumptions:
- The travel destination is only provided within United States.
- Also, the travel time is taken in terms of season.
- The place of interest is taken in terms of East or West Coast.
